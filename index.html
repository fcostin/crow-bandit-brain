      <p>
        Input stimuli are modelled in a simplistic way: the space of input stimuli is modelled as a set containing four distinct elements.
        There is no uncertainly in what element is observed and no attempt to model perception: instead, the input stimulus chosen by the
        experimenter is mapped to a categorical variable in feature space that the crow may observe as a direct input. The crow starts with
        no knowledge about the mapping from stimuli and actions to rewards, and needs to learn this by selecting and performing an action
        in response to each input element. There are only two actions: "react" and "wait". A reward of 1 is given for performing the
        "correct" action in response to the stimuli. Incorrect actions receive a reward of 0.
      </p>
      <p> 
        The learning algorithm is based on upper confidence bounds: for each combination of input stimulus and possible action, the crow
        stores how many times it has observed that exact stimulus, how many times it performed that action in response, the observed mean
        reward value. From these values the crow can estimate upper-confidence bounds on the reward associated with performing an action.
        The crow always selects an action to perform that has a minimal value of upper-confidence bound. Ties are broken randomly.

        Critique of this demo:
        <ul>
          <li>No perpeption model to distinguish what stimulus the experimenter chose versus what was
            perceived. This is unrealistic.</li>
          <li>If two input stimuli differ then they are regarded as corresponding to completely different situations.
            There is no concept of similarity where the crow might reason "this novel situation is only slightly
            different from another situation i am very familiar with". This has two downsides: the learning rate of
            the crow will be much slower than otherwise when faced with situations that only differ slightly from
            well-understood situations, and the crow will need an amount of memory proportional to the number of
            distinct input stimuli observed, in order to remember every detail of every situation ever observed.
