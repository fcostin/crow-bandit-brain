  <h3>crow-bandit-brain demos</h3>

      Introduction: this page contains a sequence of demos that crudely model the experimental protocol and learning task of a crow.
      See <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6511/1626">Figure 1; Nieder, Wagener & Rinnert - A neural correlate of sensory consciousness in a corvid bird</a>.

      Demo: <a href="demo/1-discrete-bandit/index.html">crow-learner with no perception model and basic discrete UCB learning algorithm</a>.
      <p>
        Input stimuli are modelled in a simplistic way: the space of input stimuli is modelled as a set containing four distinct elements.
        There is no uncertainly in what element is observed and no attempt to model perception: instead, the input stimulus chosen by the
        experimenter is mapped to a categorical variable in feature space that the crow may observe as a direct input. The crow starts with
        no knowledge about the mapping from stimuli and actions to rewards, and needs to learn this by selecting and performing an action
        in response to each input element. There are only two actions: "react" and "wait". A reward of 1 is given for performing the
        "correct" action in response to the stimuli. Incorrect actions receive a reward of 0.
      </p>
      <p> 
        The learning algorithm is based on upper confidence bounds: for each combination of input stimulus and possible action, the crow
        stores how many times it has observed that exact stimulus, how many times it performed that action in response, the observed mean
        reward value. From these values the crow can estimate upper-confidence bounds on the reward associated with performing an
        action. The crow always selects an action to perform that has a maximum value of upper-confidence bound. Ties are broken randomly.

        Critique of this demo:
        <ul>
          <li>No perpeption model to distinguish what stimulus the experimenter chose versus what was
            perceived. This is unrealistic.</li>
          <li>If two input stimuli differ then they are regarded as corresponding to completely different situations.
            There is no concept of similarity where the crow might reason "this novel situation is only slightly
            different from another situation i am very familiar with". This has two downsides: the learning rate of
            the crow will be much slower than otherwise when faced with situations that only differ slightly from
            well-understood situations, and the crow will need an amount of memory proportional to the number of
            distinct input stimuli observed, in order to remember every detail of every situation ever observed.

      Plans:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Model the distinction between the stimulus chosen by the experimenter and what is pereceived by the crow. Input stimulus chosen
          by the experimenter will be modelled as a vector of three continuous variables:
          <ul>
            <li>g - grey light intensity - set to a value of 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 or 1.0</li>
            <li>r - red light intensity - set to a value of 0.0 or 1.0</li>
            <li>b - blue light intensity - set to a value of 0.0 or 1.0</li>
          </ul>
          For example, the stimulus of "the crow is shown a medium-intensity grey light, then after a short delay is
          shown a red light" can be encoded as g = 0.6 , r = 1.0 and b = 0.0.
          The grey light variable g will correspond to the intensity of the first light shown to the crow. A value of 0.0 is regarded as
          "no stimulus" while a value of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 or 1.0 is regarded as "stimulus". A noise term will also be added to these
          values to make it harder to clearly distinguish between each pair of adjacent intensity values.
          Noise will also be added to the two red and blue light intensity variables. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Model the crow's perception as a stage of feature detectors that transform raw perceived inputs into features.
          These features will be hand-crafted, not-learned, as: 1, g, r, b, gr, gb, rb. That is, the three raw input variables
          g r and b will be transformed into a space of monomial basis vectors of degree at most 2. This is a nonlinear
          transformation of the raw perceived inputs and is necessary as the crow needs to learn the association between
          pairs of input variables in order to succeed at this task.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use LinUCB with disjoint linear models as the active learning algorithm to select actions and learn the relationship
          between features and actions to rewards. LinUCB will consume the features generated by the feature detectors,
          not the raw perceived input variables. The previous nonlinear feature transformation stage is necessary as LinUCB is
          collection of linear models. Each linear model is based on the assumption that the expected reward of performing
          an action can be explained as a linear combination of the input features, but for this learning task the crow
          crucially needs to learn interactions between the perceived inputs g, r and b in order to obtain more rewards.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Critique of this demo:
      <ul>
        <li>The feature detection layer is hand-crafted and not learned.</li>
        <li>This active learning algorithm, LinUCB with disjoint linear models, builds and maintains a linear model for
          each action. Information learned after performing any given action is never used when performing a
          different action. In a richer model of this experiment, the crow could have a choice of far more than two
          different actions to use when responding to stimuli. Failing to generalise between "similar" actions performed
          in response to "similar" stimuli could slow the learning rate.
        </li>
        <li>The perception model is still very simple, time is not modelled as passing while the crow perceives lights or waits for the next light.</li>
